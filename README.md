Hi, I’m Sebastian — a Data Scientist with an engineering background, focused on turning complex data into actionable insights for product and operational decision-making.

I specialize in analyzing real-world, imperfect datasets and building interpretable predictive models that improve service availability, efficiency, and user experience. Formerly a Senior BIM Lead in structural engineering, I bring systems thinking and high attention to detail to data validation, modeling, and communication with non-technical stakeholders.
